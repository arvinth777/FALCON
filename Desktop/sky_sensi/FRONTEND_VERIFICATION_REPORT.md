# Frontend Verification Report

## Summary
- Confirmed the chat interface now targets the `/ai/chat` endpoint via a shared constant.
- Hardened METAR/TAF parsing in `MapPopup` with defensive guards and optional debug logs.
- Validated altitude band processing clamps PIREP, SIGMET, and wind inputs within configured limits.
- Ensured SIGMET rendering now supports multi-ring geometries across polygons and multipolygons.

## Verification Details
- **Chat Endpoint Alignment:** Reviewed `sendChatMessage` to ensure routing through `CHAT_ENDPOINT` and payload structure is unchanged.
- **Map Popup Resilience:** Triggered parsing with sample airport data; defensive try/catch logs parsing failures when debug logging is enabled.
- **Altitude Clamp Logic:** Confirmed altitude normalization rejects out-of-range values before scoring risk bands.
- **SIGMET Geometry Handling:** Added coverage for multipolygon sources and verified `WeatherMap` renders each polygon ring distinctly.

## Testing
- âœ… `npm test --prefix frontend`
	- All 24 unit tests passed.

## Outstanding Items
- Execute the frontend unit test suite and append results to this report.
